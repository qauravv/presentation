## 1. WHAT THIS IS

A 47-minute intellectual thriller disguised as a seminar. Not a lecture. Not a slideshow. A piece of theater that happens to use a screen.

**Presenter:** Columbia student delivering the second half of a two-part seminar. Partner covers Darwin's biography and observations. This presentation covers the IDEAS — what Darwin actually figured out, why we know it's true, why it nearly collapsed, and how modern science rescued and transformed it.

**Audience:** ~15 Columbia undergrads. Sitting close. Eye-contact distance. First names. They're smart, fast, and allergic to being lectured at. They should feel like they're in a conversation that keeps blowing their mind.

**Duration:** ~47 minutes + Q&A
**Total slides:** 42 main + 3 appendix (hidden)
**Aspect ratio:** 16:9

---

## 2. THE BIG DESIGN IDEA — "The Presentation Evolves"

The talk is about evolution. **The presentation itself evolves.**

The visual language starts PRIMITIVE — nearly black, raw, analog. Single images. Silence. As we move through history (Darwin → Mendel → DNA → evo-devo → present), the slides become progressively more sophisticated, colorful, layered, and modern. By the evo-devo section the slides feel like spreads from a high-end science magazine. At the close, we strip back to elemental simplicity — one sentence on black.

This isn't a gimmick. It IS the argument. The talk claims complexity emerges from simplicity through accumulation. The slides prove it visually.

### The Evolution of the Slides Themselves

| Era in the Talk | Visual Mode | Palette Feel | Texture |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Cold Open (1–3) | Raw. Almost nothing. | Black + single image | None. Void. |
| Darwin's Theory (4–19) | Naturalist journal | Warm bone, amber, sepia | Subtle paper/canvas grain |
| The Evidence (20–25) | Museum exhibit | Warm stone, specimen lighting | Clean glass-case precision |
| The Flaw + Rescue (26–33) | Dramatic tension | Dark slate, signal red, then relief | Stripped. Empty. Then warm again. |
| DNA + Evo-Devo (34–40) | Modern science magazine | Cool precision. Moss, glacier blue, sharp whites | Clean data-viz. Contemporary. |
| Close (41–44) | Return to elemental | Black + white + ember | Nothing. Back to the void. Full circle. |

The audience won't consciously notice this. They'll FEEL it. The room gets warmer, then colder, then warmer, then sharp, then quiet. That's the design doing emotional work.

## 3. COLOR PALETTE

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| Primary Dark | Obsidian | #0F172A | Deep backgrounds — the void, drama, emotional beats |
| Primary Light | Bone | #FAF9F6 | Light backgrounds — teaching, explanation, warmth |
| Accent | Ember | #E07A2F | Key terms, reveals, punchlines, the fire of insight |
| Nature | Deep Moss | #2D5A3D | Living systems, DNA, evo-devo, "life" moments |
| Quiet | Slate | #94A3B8 | Captions, secondary text, attributions, whisper-weight |
| Danger | Signal Red | #C53030 | ONLY for: the flaw section, "wrong" comparisons, strikethroughs |
| Cool | Glacier Blue | #CBD5E1 | Timeline connectors, neutral data, modern science accents |
| Highlight BG | Warm Sand | #F5E6D0 | Rare — callout boxes, special emphasis panels on Bone slides |

**Palette progression rule:** Acts I–III use the warm end (Ember, Bone, Warm Sand). The Evidence section adds museum neutrals. DNA/Evo-Devo shift cooler (Moss, Glacier Blue, sharper whites). Close returns to Obsidian + Ember only. The palette moves through time with the content.

## 4. TYPOGRAPHY

| Element | Font | Size Range | Weight | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Section headers | Playfair Display | 48–56pt | Bold | Serif. Old-world authority. Like a book title. |
| Slide titles | Playfair Display | 36–44pt | Bold | |
| Big statements / reveals | Playfair Display | 32–44pt | Bold | The lines people photograph. |
| Body / explanation text | Inter | 20–24pt | Regular (400) | Clean modern sans-serif. Excellent screen readability. |
| Quotes | Playfair Display | 24–36pt | Italic | |
| Code / Algorithm text | JetBrains Mono | 22–28pt | Regular | Monospace. Used ONLY for the algorithm sequence (Slides 14–19). |
| Captions & labels | Inter | 14–16pt | Regular, Slate | |
| Attributions | Inter | 14–16pt | Medium, Ember | |

**Fallback stack:** If Playfair unavailable → Georgia. If Inter unavailable → Calibri. If JetBrains Mono unavailable → Courier New.

**Typography personality:** Playfair = the voice of authority, Darwin's era, big statements. Inter = the voice of explanation, clarity, the modern presenter. JetBrains Mono = the voice of the algorithm, cold, mechanical, inhuman. These three voices should feel like different characters.

## 5. VISUAL RULES — The Commandments

1. **No bullet points. Ever.** Line breaks, numbered sequences, visual cards, or spatial layout only. Bullets are the enemy of drama.
2. **Full-bleed images** where specified. Cinematic. AI-generated is encouraged for custom compositions. No generic stock. No clip art. No Shutterstock energy.
3. **Max 3 text elements** on any image slide. The image IS the slide; text is a whisper over it.
4. **Text-only slides = movie title cards.** Centered. Dramatic whitespace. Let the words breathe. If it doesn't feel like it could be a frame in a film, it has too much on it.
5. **Animations: fade-in on click ONLY.** No fly-ins, no bounces, no zooms, no spins. Every motion is a quiet arrival. Fade duration: 0.5–0.8 seconds.
6. **Dark slides (Obsidian) = emotional beats.** Light slides (Bone) = teaching moments. The alternation creates rhythm — inhale, exhale.
7. **Consistent caption placement:** Bottom-left for image sources/attributions. Always. Predictability lets the eye relax.
8. **The 3-Second Rule:** If someone can't absorb a slide's core idea in 3 seconds of looking, it has too much.
9. **Breathing room:** Minimum 40px margin on all sides. Text never crowds edges. Whitespace is a design element, not wasted space.
10. **Image treatment:** All photographs get a very subtle vignette (darkened edges, ~5%) to focus attention center. All illustrations/diagrams sit on clean backgrounds without borders unless specified.

## 6. INTERACTIVITY & ROOM STRATEGY

This is 15 people, not an auditorium. The room is a tool. Use it.

### Physical Moments

| Moment | Slide | What Happens | Why It Works |
|--------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **The Coin & Paint** | 29 | Presenter pulls out a coin and a small cup of pre-mixed murky water. "Darwin needed THIS [flips coin — heads or tails, discrete]. Everyone assumed THIS [holds up murky water — blended, gone]." | Only physical prop in the talk. Lands because it's the only one. Tactile memory anchors the abstract concept. |

### Verbal Interactions

| Moment | Slide | What Happens | Why It Works |
|--------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **The Tooth Fairy Test** | 12 | After explaining the design argument: "Quick — no judgment — anyone here find this argument at least a little convincing? The eye DOES look designed." Let hands go up. "Good. Hold that thought. I'm about to try to talk you out of it." | Commits them emotionally before the inversion. Now they have stakes. |
| **The Cod Question** | 17 | "A cod lays two million eggs a year. If they all survived, quick — how long before the ocean is wall-to-wall cod?" Take a guess or two. "Three years. Three years to fill the Atlantic." | Makes overproduction visceral. The absurdity of the number lands better when THEY do the math. |
| **Show of Hands** | 31 | "Quick — show of hands. Who thinks Darwin ever read Mendel's paper?" Pause. Count. "Good instinct — but no. He never saw it." | Everyone gets it wrong or right for the wrong reasons. Sets up the tragedy. |
| **The Prediction Game** | 37 | Before the Pax6 reveal: "I want genuine guesses. They took a mouse eye gene and put it in a fly embryo. 500 million years of divergence. What do you think happens?" Take 2–3 answers out loud. | Wrong predictions make the real answer hit 10x harder. The room has committed to an expectation. |
| **The Rice Roast** | 36 | After showing rice has more genes than humans: pause, let laughter build. "I'll let that sit. You are, genetically speaking, simpler than the thing you had for lunch." | Self-deprecating humor at the species level. Works because it's true. Don't talk over the laugh. |
| **The Close** | 44 | "What surprised you?" Direct eye contact. If silence > 5 seconds, pick someone: "[Name], you reacted during the eye section — what were you thinking?" | "What surprised you?" is 1000x better than "any questions?" because it asks for a feeling, not a performance. |

### Mandatory Silences

These are not "pauses." They are DESIGNED SILENCES — the most powerful tool in the presentation. Do not fill them. Do not look at notes. Make eye contact with the room.

| Slide | After What | Duration | Why |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----|
| 30 | "He never solved this problem." | 3–4 sec | Let the weight of a life's work with a hole in it land. |
| 32 | "My time will come." | 3 sec | Grief. A man who knew he was right and died unread. |
| 37 | "Put it into a fruit fly embryo." (before reveal) | 3 sec | Suspense. The room is waiting. Make them wait. |
| 37 | "A fly eye. Compound lenses. In the right place." | 4–5 sec | Awe. This is the peak. Let it ring. |
| 43 | "And none of it was inevitable." | 3 sec | Vertigo. The implication needs time to expand. |

### Speed Zones

| Zone | Slides | Pace | Why |
|------|--------|------|-----|
| **SPRINT** | 15–18 (four facts) | 10–15 sec each | These are obvious. Speed = confidence. Lingering = boring. |
| **SPRINT** | 35 (DNA intro) | 30 sec max | They know this. Acknowledge it and move. |
| **SPRINT** | 41 (epigenetics + HGT) | 90 sec total | Overview, not deep dive. |
| **SLOW** | 19 (the consequence) | Let each click breathe | Building the machine. Each piece matters. |
| **SLOW** | 30–31 (death → monastery) | Emotional turn | The air should leave the room. |
| **SLOW** | 37 (Pax6) | The climax | Longest pauses in the talk. |
| **SLOW** | 43–44 (close) | Slower than feels natural | Last impression. Earn the silence. |

---

## 7. SOUND DESIGN (Optional — Use If Room Has Speakers)

| Moment | Slides | Audio | Volume |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Cold open | 1–2 | Ultra-low ambient hum. Almost subliminal. Fades when presenter speaks. | Barely perceptible |
| Algorithm build | 19 | Subtle rhythmic pulse, accelerating with each click. Cuts to DEAD SILENCE on "= everything." | Quiet but felt |
| The Flaw | 26–30 | Nothing. No ambient. Silence after the algorithm sequence creates unease. | — |
| Pax6 reveal | 37, click 3 | Single sustained piano note or low chord. Fades over 5 seconds. | Gentle |
| Darwin's words | 43 | Faint wind + distant birdsong. The world outside the argument. | Whisper |

**If no audio:** No loss. Pacing handles everything. But if available, it transforms the experience in 15-person rooms.

# PART TWO: SLIDE-BY-SLIDE SPECIFICATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

---

## ═══════════════════════════════════════
## COLD OPEN — Slides 1–3 (~2 min)
## "The Trap"
## ═══════════════════════════════════════

**Section objective:** Get the room to agree the eye looks designed. Then plant the seed of doubt.

---

### SLIDE 1: The Eye

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Pure black (#000000)

**Visual:** Full-bleed extreme macro of a human iris. Not a medical image — ART. Fill 80%+ of the frame with the iris. Individual muscle fibers visible, color striations, the pupil as a black void. This should feel like a landscape photographed from space.

**AI prompt:** "Extreme macro photograph of a human iris, amber and green heterochromia, individual radial muscle fibers visible, crystalline texture detail, shot on macro lens, deep black background, National Geographic quality, cinematic 16:9, no reflections, no eyelashes in frame"

**Text:** Bottom-left corner only.
`Who designed this?` — Inter, 18pt, white at 55% opacity.

**Build:** Static. Everything loads together.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"My partner walked you through Darwin's life — the voyage, what he saw. I'm picking up where they left off: what Darwin MADE of those observations, and why it still matters more than anything else in biology. But I want to start here. [beat] Look at this. 130 million photoreceptors. An auto-focusing lens. A self-cleaning surface that operates for 80 years without a software update. [beat] Feels designed, right?"

---

### SLIDE 2: The Canyon

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Pure black (#000000)

**Visual:** Full-bleed aerial Grand Canyon, shot from DIRECTLY above. Golden hour. The layered geology should form concentric patterns that deliberately echo the circular iris on Slide 1. The visual rhyme IS the argument — both circular, both layered, both complex, one designed, one not.

**AI prompt:** "Aerial photograph of Grand Canyon from directly above, golden hour sunlight, visible geological layers forming concentric curved patterns, Colorado River as dark thread at bottom, vast scale, cinematic 16:9, warm light"

**Text:** Same position, same styling as Slide 1. Bottom-left.
`Who designed this?` — Inter, 18pt, white at 55% opacity.

**Build:** Static. Identical layout to Slide 1. The repetition is intentional.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Same question. [long pause — 3 seconds] Nobody. Water and gravity. Five million years. No architect. No blueprint. Just physics and time. [beat] Darwin's question — the dangerous one: what if these two images have more in common than you think?"

---

### SLIDE 3: Title Card

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Visual:** Very faint branching pattern filling entire background at 6–8% opacity. Should simultaneously suggest: river deltas, neural networks, tree branches, phylogenetic trees, lightning. All of these at once. Something alive hiding in the dark.

**AI prompt:** "Abstract white branching fractal pattern on black background, combining qualities of river deltas, neural networks, tree branches, and lightning bolts, organic and mathematical, seamless, very high detail, suitable for use as faint background texture"

**Center text (stacked):**
- `THE DANGEROUS IDEA` — Playfair Display, 60pt, white, bold, letter-spacing +3pt
- [40px gap]
- `Darwin's Theory of Evolution` — Inter, 22pt, Slate
- `& the Science That Transformed It` — Inter, 22pt, Slate
- [120px gap]
- `[Presenter Name] · Columbia University · [Date]` — Inter, 14pt, Slate at 50%

**Build:** Title fades in (0.8s). Subtitle 0.6s after. Bottom line 0.4s after that.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"In 1844, Darwin wrote to his best friend Joseph Hooker: 'It is like confessing a murder.' Fifteen years before he published. He'd figured something out and was terrified of what it would do. Not to his career — to how every person understood their place in nature. [beat] Here's the idea. And here's what it means: evolution is descent with modification. Organisms change across generations. That single process produced both the similarities and the differences across every living thing on this planet. Simple sentence. Took 150 years to prove, and it's still the most dangerous idea in science."

## ═══════════════════════════════════════
## ACT I: FROM OBSERVATIONS TO THEORY — Slides 4–9 (~5 min)
## "He Had the Pieces"
## ═══════════════════════════════════════

**Section objective:** Bridge from partner's biography material to the mechanism. Reframe the observations as puzzles, introduce the analogy and Malthus as the final ingredients.

**Visual mode:** Naturalist journal. Warm tones. Subtle paper/canvas texture on Bone slides. Mix of illustration and photography. Hand-drawn elements welcome. This section should feel like you're leafing through a beautiful 19th-century field notebook.

---

### SLIDE 4: The Bridge

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Visual:** AI-generated wide shot. The HMS Beagle, SMALL against a massive South American coastline. Dramatic storm light. Caspar David Friedrich energy — one tiny human vessel against the enormity of nature.

**AI prompt:** "HMS Beagle sailing ship very small in frame against dramatic towering South American coastal cliffs, stormy golden light breaking through dark clouds, vast turbulent ocean, romantic era oil painting style, atmospheric, cinematic 16:9, the ship should be tiny and the landscape should be immense"

**Text overlay (bottom, over subtle dark gradient band):**
- `HMS Beagle · 1831–1836` — Playfair Display, 24pt, white
- `[Partner's name] showed you what Darwin saw.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `Now: what he did with it.` — Inter, 18pt, Ember

**Build:** Static.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Quick bridge from where [partner] left off. You know the voyage — five years, South America, the Galápagos, Australia. You know what he saw. But observations alone aren't a theory. A theory needs a mechanism. Darwin had four puzzles, one analogy, and one economist. Let me show you how he put them together."

---

### SLIDE 5: The Four Puzzles

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6) with very subtle canvas texture

**Layout:** 2×2 grid. Each quadrant contains one image and one caption. Separated by thin hairlines (Slate at 15%). Clean, gallery-style — like specimens in a museum case.

**Top-left:**
- Image: Galápagos finch heads in profile — 3–4 species, different beak shapes. Naturalist illustration style, warm tones.
- Caption: `Finch beaks: different shapes, different diets, island by island` — Inter, 15pt, Obsidian

**Top-right:**
- Image: Galápagos tortoises — dome vs. saddle-back shell comparison. Illustration style.
- Caption: `Tortoise shells: distinct forms on each island — officials could ID the island` — Inter, 15pt, Obsidian

**Bottom-left:**
- Image: Fossil skeleton next to modern animal (Glyptodon + armadillo). Clear size contrast.
- Caption: `Fossils: extinct giants resembling living species nearby. Why?` — Inter, 15pt, Obsidian

**Bottom-right:**
- Image: Simplified world map with two climate-matched regions highlighted, different animal silhouettes in each.
- Caption: `Biogeography: same climates, different continents, completely different species` — Inter, 15pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Each quadrant fades in on click (4 clicks).

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Four puzzles. [click] Finches — every island, different beaks, different food sources. [click] Tortoises — same pattern. The governor told Darwin he could identify which island a tortoise came from by the shell alone. [click] Fossils — giant extinct armadillo-like creatures, right next to living armadillos. Smaller, but obviously related. Why would a designer build a giant version, kill it, then build a smaller copy? [click] And the big one: take two deserts on different continents. Same temperature, same rainfall, same everything. Completely different animals. If a designer was optimizing for environment, you'd expect the same solution. You never get it. Four puzzles. No existing explanation could handle all four."

---

### SLIDE 6: The Pigeon Argument

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Full-width image (top 55%), text below.

**Image:** Dramatic lineup of 6–8 wildly different pigeon breeds — fantail, pouter, jacobin, tumbler, English carrier, frill-back. Arranged in a horizontal row. They should look like completely different species.

**AI prompt:** "Six dramatically different pigeon breeds arranged in a line on a warm neutral background, showing extreme variation in body shape, plumage, and features — fantail with spread tail, pouter with inflated crop, jacobin with feathered hood, tumbler, English carrier with wattles, frill-back with curled feathers — naturalist scientific illustration style, warm lighting, 16:9"

**Text below image:**
- `All of these are the same species.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Ember
- [16px gap]
- `Breeders choose who mates. Over generations, populations transform.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `If humans can do this in centuries — what can nature do in billions of years?` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Image on load. Text fades in on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Before explaining natural selection, Darwin spends his entire first chapter on pigeons. Not God. Not fossils. Pigeons. [click] Same species. Every single one. Human breeders created this diversity just by choosing who mates with whom for a few hundred years. His logic: if WE can do this intentionally in centuries, what could nature do unintentionally over a billion years? That's the analogy that cracked it open."

---

### SLIDE 7: Common Descent

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Left 40% image, right 60% text.

**Left:** High-resolution scan of Darwin's actual 1837 "I think" notebook page — the first tree of life sketch. REAL historical document, not a recreation. Warm-toned, showing paper texture, his handwriting.

**Right:**
- `Common Descent` — Playfair Display, 30pt, Obsidian
- [12px gap]
- `Darwin's most radical claim:` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- [8px gap]
- `All living things share` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- `a single common ancestor.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Ember
- [24px gap]
- `Not a metaphor. Literally.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `You, the pigeon outside, the bacteria on your phone —` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `one unbroken chain. Billions of years.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Notebook image on load. Right text on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"1837. Darwin's private notebook. 'I think' — and then the first tree of life ever sketched. [click] His most radical claim: everything alive shares a single common ancestor. Not a metaphor — literally. You and the pigeon. You and the oak tree outside. You and the E. coli on your phone screen right now. One trunk, endless branches, connected by an unbroken chain going back billions of years. He knew this was the part people wouldn't forgive."

---

### SLIDE 8: The Malthus Trigger

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Small image left (20%), text right (80%).

**Left:** Portrait of Thomas Malthus or cover of "An Essay on the Principle of Population." Small. Sepia-toned. The slide is about the IDEA, not the man.

**Right:**
- `The Missing Piece` — Playfair Display, 28pt, Obsidian
- [16px gap]
- `1838 — Darwin reads Malthus, an economist:` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- [12px gap]
- `Population grows exponentially.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- `Resources grow linearly — if at all.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- `Result: a permanent struggle for existence.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- [28px gap]

**On click:**
- `Darwin's leap:` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `In that struggle, who survives isn't random.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember

**Build:** Main text on load. Leap on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"He had observations and an analogy but no engine. What does the selecting in nature? There's no farmer choosing the best pigeon. Then he reads Malthus — an economist writing about human poverty. Populations always outgrow their food supply. Always. [click] Darwin's leap: if more are born than can possibly survive, and there's variation among them, then the ones with even a tiny edge make it. Scarcity IS the breeder. Death IS the selector. He had the pieces. Now he had the engine."

---

### SLIDE 9: Transition — Now: The Mechanism

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Text (centered, generous vertical spacing):**
- `He had the observations.` — Inter, 22pt, white at 80%
- `He had the analogy.` — Inter, 22pt, white at 80%
- `He had the trigger.` — Inter, 22pt, white at 80%
- [60px gap]
- `Now: the mechanism.` — Playfair Display, 36pt, Ember

**Build:** First three on load (simultaneous). Last line on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Observations. Analogy. Malthusian trigger. [click] Now he formalizes it into the most important algorithm in the history of science."

---

## ═══════════════════════════════════════
## ACT II: THE MECHANISM — Slides 10–21 (~10 min)
## "Four Facts and One Terrifying Consequence"
## ═══════════════════════════════════════

**Section objective:** Build the algorithm piece by piece. The room should feel the logic click into place — and then feel the vertigo of what it implies.

**Visual mode:** This section introduces the monospace "code" aesthetic for the algorithm — a visual signal that we're describing something mechanical, procedural, inhuman. Hard contrast with the warm naturalist journal of Act I. Teaching slides stay on Bone, but the algorithm slides hit Obsidian.

---

### SLIDE 10: The World Before Darwin

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Left image (40%), right text (60%).

**Left:** Close-up photograph of a mechanical pocket watch, gears exposed, beautiful precision. Sepia/warm tones.

**Right:**
- `Before Darwin, there was one explanation:` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- [8px gap]
- `DESIGN` — Playfair Display, 48pt, Ember
- [20px gap]
- `Complexity requires a creator.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- `An eye implies an eye-maker.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- `A wing implies a wing-maker.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- [16px gap]
- `— William Paley, Natural Theology, 1802` — Inter, 16pt, Slate

**Build:** Static.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"For all of human history, one answer. Design. William Paley, 1802: you find a watch, you infer a watchmaker. You find an eye, you infer an eye-maker. Clean, intuitive, satisfying. And the only framework available for thousands of years."

---

### SLIDE 11: Darwin's Inversion

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Top half (on load):**
- `What if the appearance of design` — Playfair Display, 32pt, Obsidian
- `is a` `RESULT` `, not evidence?` — Playfair Display, 32pt, Obsidian. "RESULT" in Ember.

**Bottom half (on click):**
- `Organisms look "designed" because` — Inter, 22pt, Slate
- `the ones that didn't work are dead.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Top on load. Bottom on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Darwin's inversion. The whole argument flipped. What if complexity isn't evidence OF a designer — what if it's the RESULT of a process with no designer at all? [click] Organisms look designed because the badly designed ones got eaten. Froze. Starved. Didn't mate. You don't need a designer. You just need death and enough time."

---

### SLIDE 12: The Tooth Fairy Test — Interaction Beat

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Text (centered):**
- `Honest question for the room:` — Inter, 22pt, Slate
- [20px gap]
- `Does the design argument feel` — Playfair Display, 28pt, Obsidian
- `at least a little convincing?` — Playfair Display, 28pt, Obsidian
- [40px gap]
- `The eye really does look designed.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate, italic

**Build:** Static. This slide exists for the INTERACTION, not the text.

**🎯 INTERACTION:** "Quick — no judgment. Anyone here find the design argument at least a little compelling? The eye DOES look designed. Hands?" [Let hands go up. Acknowledge.] "Good. Hold that feeling. Because I'm about to try to talk you out of it."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Quick — honest — no wrong answer. Does Paley's argument feel at least a LITTLE convincing? The eye really does look designed. [take hands] Good. Hold that. Because what I'm about to show you is specifically designed to break that intuition. And if it works, you'll feel it shift. Ready?"

---

### SLIDE 13: Algorithm Header

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Text (monospace, left-aligned with left padding ~15%):**

```
natural_selection.exe
```
— JetBrains Mono, 32pt, Ember

```
// Five requirements. One consequence.
// None of the requirements were controversial.
// The consequence was devastating.
```
— JetBrains Mono, 18pt, Slate

**Build:** Title on load. Comments fade in 1s later.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Natural selection is an algorithm. Five inputs. One output. I'm going to give you the five inputs. Every single one was obvious and uncontroversial in 1859. The terrifying part is what falls out when you combine them."

---

### SLIDES 14–18: The Five Requirements

**Unified template design:** All five slides share an IDENTICAL layout. Fast rhythm. Same visual skeleton each time. The consistency IS the point — you're building a machine, component by component, and the audience feels the accumulation.

**Template:**
- Background: Bone (#FAF9F6)
- Left 20%: Giant number watermark (Playfair Display, 280pt, Ember at 10% opacity)
- Right 80%: Requirement statement in monospace, one-line explanation in Inter, supporting image at bottom (30% slide height)
- All text aligned to the same grid positions across all five slides

---

#### SLIDE 14: Requirement 1 — Variation

**Number watermark:** `1`
**Statement:** `Variation exists` — JetBrains Mono, 28pt, Obsidian
**Explanation:** `No two organisms are identical. Natural genetic variation in every population.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate
**Image:** Row of finch silhouettes with clearly different beak shapes. 5–6 profiles. Ember-tinted.

**Build:** Static. **PACING: 12 seconds.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Requirement one. Variation. No two organisms are identical — look around this room. There must be genetic diversity in the population for anything to happen. Not controversial. Next."

#### SLIDE 15: Requirement 2 — Inheritance

**Number watermark:** `2`
**Statement:** `Traits are heritable` — JetBrains Mono, 28pt, Obsidian
**Explanation:** `Offspring resemble parents. Traits pass from one generation to the next through genetic material.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate
**Image:** Parent + offspring resemblance — a bird and chick, or a dog and puppy. Visual emphasis on similarity.

**Build:** Static. **PACING: 10 seconds.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Requirement two. Inheritance. Tall parents tend to have tall kids. Traits pass through generations. Breeders knew this for thousands of years. Not controversial. Next."

---

#### SLIDE 16: Requirement 3 — Overproduction

**Number watermark:** `3`
**Statement:** `More are born than can survive` — JetBrains Mono, 28pt, Obsidian
**Explanation:** `A cod: 2 million eggs/year. An oak: millions of acorns. Yet populations stay roughly stable.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate
**Image:** Sea turtle hatchlings scrambling toward ocean. Dozens on sand. Vast ocean ahead. The odds should feel visceral.

**Build:** Static. **PACING: 20 seconds (includes interaction).**

**🎯 INTERACTION — The Cod Question:**
"A cod lays two million eggs a year. Quick math — if every egg survived, how long to fill the Atlantic? [take a guess] About three years. Three years of unchecked cod reproduction to fill an ocean. Something is killing almost all of them. Nobody in 1859 disagreed with this. They just didn't think about what it means."

---

#### SLIDE 17: Requirement 4 — Differential Survival

**Number watermark:** `4`
**Statement:** `Survival isn't random` — JetBrains Mono, 28pt, Obsidian
**Explanation:** `The faster rabbit escapes the fox. The camouflaged moth avoids the bird. Some variants have a statistical edge.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate
**Image:** Peppered moth on tree bark, nearly invisible. The image itself demonstrates the principle.

**Build:** Static. **PACING: 15 seconds.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Requirement four. Differential survival. Who dies isn't random. The faster rabbit outruns the fox. The camouflaged moth doesn't get spotted. Can everyone see the moth? [pause] Barely? That's why it's alive. Some variants have an edge. Still not controversial."

---

#### SLIDE 18: Requirement 5 — Time

**Number watermark:** `5`
**Statement:** `Sufficient time` — JetBrains Mono, 28pt, Obsidian
**Explanation:** `Enough generations for selection to accumulate changes. Evolutionary change is gradual.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate
**Image:** Grand Canyon layers (callback to Slide 2) — geological strata representing deep time. Same location, new meaning.

**Build:** Static. **PACING: 10 seconds.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Requirement five. Time. Enough generations for small changes to accumulate. Recognize this? [gesture at canyon image] Layers of time. Same image, new meaning. Not controversial. OK — five obvious facts. Here's what happens when you combine them."

### ⭐ SLIDE 19: THE CONSEQUENCE — Primary Money Shot

**Mode:** IMPACT (MAXIMUM)
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Build sequence (centered, stacking vertically, one click each):**

- **Click 1:** `variation` — JetBrains Mono, 30pt, white
- **Click 2:** `+ inheritance` — JetBrains Mono, 30pt, white
- **Click 3:** `+ overproduction` — JetBrains Mono, 30pt, white
- **Click 4:** `+ differential survival` — JetBrains Mono, 30pt, white
- **Click 5:** `+ time` — JetBrains Mono, 30pt, white

[**MANDATORY 3–4 SECOND SILENCE. SAY NOTHING.**]

- **Click 6:** `= everything` — Playfair Display, 52pt, Ember, bold

[Below, fading in with click 6:]
`No programmer. No goals. No direction.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate, italic

**Build:** 6 clicks. The pause before click 6 is the single most important silence in the first half of the presentation.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"[click] Variation. [click] Plus inheritance. [click] Plus overproduction. [click] Plus non-random survival. [click] Plus deep time."
[3–4 full seconds of silence. Look at the room. Let the tension build.]
"[click] Everything. Eyes. Wings. Immune systems. Brains. Language. The entire living world — produced by an algorithm with no programmer. Daniel Dennett called this 'the single best idea anyone has ever had.' And Darwin was terrified of it."

### 🎬 SLIDE 19b: OPTIONAL — Natural Selection Simulation Video

**Mode:** CINEMATIC | **Background:** Black | **Duration:** 25–30 seconds

**Video specification:**
- Frame 1 (0–3s): 200 colored dots scattered on a field. Random colors. A "predator sweep" zone moves across.
- Frame 2 (3–8s): Dots matching the background survive. Others vanish. Survivors duplicate with slight color variation.
- Frame 3 (8–18s): Time-lapse through 15 generations. Population converges toward background color.
- Frame 4 (18–25s): BACKGROUND COLOR CHANGES. The majority is suddenly wrong. Rare "mutant" dots survive. Population shifts again.
- Final overlay (25–30s): `No one is choosing. The environment is choosing.` — Inter, 20pt, white

**If not feasible:** Skip entirely. Slide 19 is powerful alone.

### SLIDE 20: "Survival of the Fittest" — What It Actually Means

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**TOP HALF (on load):**

**Left side — the misconception (with strikethroughs):**
- `"Survival of the fittest"` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Obsidian
- [12px gap]
- `≠ strongest` — Inter, 22pt, Signal Red, strikethrough
- `≠ smartest` — Inter, 22pt, Signal Red, strikethrough
- `≠ most aggressive` — Inter, 22pt, Signal Red, strikethrough

**Right side — the reality:**
- `= whose body fits the environment` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember
- [14px gap]
- 🌡️ `Tolerating heat or drought` — Inter, 18pt, Obsidian
- 🌾 `Surviving when food shifts` — Inter, 18pt, Obsidian
- 🦠 `Resisting disease` — Inter, 18pt, Obsidian
- [10px gap]
- `Fitness is context-dependent.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- `A large body helps until there's a famine.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate

**Divider:** Thin hairline, Slate at 25%

**BOTTOM HALF (on click):**
- `Natural selection produces adaptation:` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `each generation slightly better suited to its environment.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `Not because anyone is choosing —` — Inter, 20pt, Slate
- `because the less suited ones die.` — Inter, 20pt, Ember
- [14px gap]
- `Over thousands of generations, organisms look "designed" for their niche.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `The illusion of purpose from a purposeless process.` — Inter, 18pt, Ember, italic

**Build:** Top on load. Bottom on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Quick but important. 'Survival of the fittest' — Herbert Spencer's phrase, not Darwin's — doesn't mean the biggest or the most aggressive. It means: whose body happens to FIT the current environment. Can you handle the heat? Survive when the food supply shifts? Fight off a new pathogen? And it's always context-dependent — a large body is great until there's a famine, then it's a death sentence because you need more calories. [click] Here's how adaptation actually works. Each generation, the less-suited organisms die or reproduce less. The better-suited ones have more offspring. Over thousands of generations, the population becomes exquisitely matched to its environment. It LOOKS designed. It FEELS intentional. But nobody chose anything. Death did the editing."

### SLIDE 21: What Natural Selection Is NOT + Contingency + Replacements

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**BUILD SEQUENCE:**

**Click 1 — No direction:**
- `Natural selection has no direction. No goal. No foresight.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, white
- `It doesn't favor "superior" traits — only traits useful HERE and NOW.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate

**Click 2 — Contingency:**
- `Replay evolution from scratch:` — Inter, 20pt, white
- `humans almost certainly never appear.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember
- `Every branch is an algorithmic accident, not an inevitability.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate

**Click 3 — What it replaced:**
- `What Darwin replaced:` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- Three items on one line, separated by` · `:
  `Creationism (no mechanism) · Lamarckism (wrong mechanism) · Design (no mechanism needed)` — Inter, 18pt, white
- `Darwin's version: testable, mechanistic, and confirmed by everything since.` — Inter, 18pt, Ember

**Build:** 3 clicks.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"[click] Critical: there's no direction. No endpoint. We're not smart because evolution was building toward intelligence. We're smart because a chain of accidents happened to not kill us. A trait that helps you now could kill you next century when the environment shifts. Evolution doesn't plan. [click] Stephen Jay Gould: replay the tape of life from the beginning and you'd get a completely different world. No humans. Probably no mammals. Maybe no vertebrates at all. Every branch — including ours — is an accident that happened to work. [click] What did Darwin replace? Creationism — no mechanism for change. Lamarckism — the giraffe stretches its neck and passes that on. Intuitive, but wrong: acquired traits don't rewrite your DNA. And the design argument. Darwin's version won because it's the only one that actually works as a testable, mechanistic process. And everything we've discovered in 165 years has confirmed it."

**Section objective:** Ground the theory in concrete evidence. Multiple independent lines all pointing to the same conclusion. This isn't philosophy — it's forensics.

**Visual mode:** Museum exhibit. Clean, precise, specimen-lighting energy. Think: the halls of the American Museum of Natural History. Each slide is a display case.

### SLIDE 22: The Fossil Record

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Left image (45%), right text (55%).

**Left:** Composite image showing geological strata with different fossils embedded at different levels — simpler organisms at the bottom, complex ones higher up. Museum-display quality. OR: a photograph of Tiktaalik fossil alongside a reconstruction.

**AI prompt:** "Scientific illustration showing geological rock strata cross-section with embedded fossils, simple organisms at bottom layers (trilobites, simple shells), fish above, amphibians higher, reptiles and mammals near top, each layer a different warm earth tone, museum exhibit quality, educational but beautiful, 16:9"

**Right:**
- `The Fossil Record` — Playfair Display, 28pt, Obsidian
- [14px gap]
- `Life was once radically different.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `Fossils appear in a consistent, ordered sequence` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `that has NEVER been found inverted:` — Inter, 20pt, Ember
- [12px gap]
- `Simple → complex. Unicellular → multicellular.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `Invertebrates → vertebrates. Fish → amphibians → reptiles → mammals.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `Fossils from adjacent layers are more similar than distant ones.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- [16px gap]

**On click:**
- `Transitional fossils:` — Inter, 18pt, Ember
- `Tiktaalik — a 370-million-year-old fish with a hand-like fin.` — Inter, 18pt, Obsidian
- `Caught in the act of becoming something else.` — Inter, 18pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Main text on load. Transitional fossils on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Evidence. Line one: the rocks. Fossils show a consistent, ordered sequence of life across geological time. And this sequence has NEVER been found inverted — you never find mammals below fish, never find vertebrates below invertebrates. That ordering is exactly what descent with modification predicts: simple forms first, complex forms later, and the closer two layers are, the more similar their fossils. Radiometric dating confirms the sequence independently. [click] And then there are transitional fossils — organisms caught between forms. Tiktaalik: a fish with a hand-like fin. 370 million years old. It's not quite a fish, not quite a land animal. It's the transition, frozen in stone."

### SLIDE 23: Comparative Anatomy — Bodies as History Books

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Three horizontal panels stacked vertically, each ~30% of slide height.

**Panel 1 — Homologous Structures:**
- Left: Side-by-side skeletal diagrams of a bird wing, dolphin flipper, bat wing, and human arm — bones color-coded to show correspondence. SAME bones, rearranged. Classic comparative anatomy illustration.
- Right: `HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Obsidian
  `Same bones. Different functions. One common ancestor.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
  `Your arm, a dolphin's flipper, and a bat's wing share the same skeletal blueprint.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate

**Panel 2 — Vestigial Structures (on click):**
- Left: Small illustrations — human tailbone, whale with tiny leg bone highlighted, snake pelvic girdle.
- Right: `VESTIGIAL STRUCTURES` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Obsidian
  `Inherited from ancestors, now reduced or functionless.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
  `Your tailbone. Whale leg bones. Snake pelvic girdles.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
  `Why give a whale leg bones it can't use? Design can't explain it.` — Inter, 16pt, Ember
  `Descent with modification can.` — Inter, 16pt, Ember

**Panel 3 — Analogous Structures (on click):**
- Left: Bird wing vs. insect wing — different anatomy, same function.
- Right: `ANALOGOUS STRUCTURES` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Obsidian
  `Same function. Different origin. Independent invention.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
  `Bird wings and insect wings: same job, completely different engineering.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
  `Convergent evolution — same problem, similar solution, no shared blueprint.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate

**Build:** Panel 1 on load. Panel 2 on click. Panel 3 on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Line two: bodies. Your body is a history book. Homologous structures — the bones in a bird wing, a dolphin flipper, a bat wing, and your arm are literally the SAME bones, just rearranged. Different functions, same blueprint. That only makes sense if they inherited them from a single common ancestor. [click] Vestigial structures. Your tailbone — you don't have a tail, but the bone is there. Whales have tiny leg bones buried in their bodies. Snakes have pelvic girdles. Why would a designer give a whale legs it can't use? Under design, it's absurd. Under descent with modification, it's obvious — the ancestor had legs. [click] And convergent evolution. Bird wings and insect wings — same job, completely different anatomy. When the same environmental problem appears independently, evolution sometimes invents a similar solution from scratch. No shared blueprint needed."

### SLIDE 24: Evolution in Real Time

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Three columns, each a "case study card" with a small image, title, and description.

**Card 1 (on load):**
- Image: Industrial-era peppered moth on dark bark.
- `PEPPERED MOTHS` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Obsidian
- `Industrial soot darkened trees.` — Inter, 15pt, Slate
- `Dark moths survived. Light moths were eaten.` — Inter, 15pt, Slate
- `Natural selection visible in decades.` — Inter, 15pt, Ember

**Card 2 (on click):**
- Image: Petri dish with bacterial colonies.
- `ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Obsidian
- `Bacteria evolving in hospitals. Right now.` — Inter, 15pt, Slate
- `Outpacing our best drugs.` — Inter, 15pt, Slate
- `Darwin's algorithm in the ICU.` — Inter, 15pt, Ember

**Card 3 (on click):**
- Image: Galápagos finch with measuring calipers (the Grants' fieldwork).
- `THE GRANTS' FINCH STUDY` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Obsidian
- `40 years. Galápagos. Generation by generation.` — Inter, 15pt, Slate
- `Beak size shifts measurably with drought cycles.` — Inter, 15pt, Slate
- `Evolution measured, not inferred.` — Inter, 15pt, Ember

**Below all three (on final click):**
`These aren't inferences from the past. They're measurements taken in real time.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Card 1 on load. Card 2 on click. Card 3 on click. Bottom text on final click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"But we don't just read evolution in rocks and bones. We can WATCH it. Peppered moths — soot from the Industrial Revolution darkened trees. Dark moths thrived. Light moths got picked off by birds. Natural selection, visible in real time. [click] Antibiotic resistance. Bacteria evolving in hospitals right now, faster than we can make new drugs. Darwin's algorithm running in the ICU. [click] And the Grants — Peter and Rosemary Grant, 40 years on the Galápagos. They measured finch beaks generation by generation. During drought, when only hard seeds remain, average beak size shifts larger within a few generations. When rain returns, it shifts back. Not inferred. Measured. [click] Evolution isn't ancient history. It's something we can watch with a ruler and a calendar."

### SLIDE 25: Transition — "But there was a problem"

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Text (centered):**
- `Elegant mechanism. Mountain of evidence.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- [30px gap]
- `But there was a problem.` — Playfair Display, 40pt, Obsidian
- [20px gap]
- `And Darwin knew it.` — Inter, 22pt, Slate

**Build:** Line 1 on load. Lines 2–3 on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"So: elegant mechanism, evidence from fossils, bodies, and real-time observation. [click] Except Darwin knew — privately, painfully — that his theory was broken. And the flaw wasn't minor. It was potentially fatal."

---

## ═══════════════════════════════════════
## ACT IV: THE FATAL FLAW — Slides 26–31 (~4 min)
## "The Hole He Couldn't Fix"
## ═══════════════════════════════════════

**Section objective:** Make the problem feel URGENT. The greatest theory in biology nearly died because of a paint metaphor.

**Visual mode:** Disrupted. Colder palette. More white space — emptiness representing the gap. The warm journal feel recedes. Something is wrong and the design should communicate it.

### SLIDE 26: Blending Inheritance

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Visual (centered, simple):** Three circles in a row:
- Circle 1: Solid deep red. Label: `Parent A`
- `+` in Slate
- Circle 2: Solid white (visible border). Label: `Parent B`
- `=` in Slate
- Circle 3: Solid pink. Label: `Offspring`

**Above diagram:** `The 19th-century assumption:` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
**Below diagram:**
- `BLENDING INHERITANCE` — Playfair Display, 28pt, Obsidian
- `Traits mix like paint. Every generation averages out.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate

**Build:** Static.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Here's the problem. In Darwin's time, everyone — including Darwin — assumed inheritance worked like mixing paint. Red parent, white parent, pink child. Every generation, traits blend. Average out. Sounds reasonable. But watch what it does to the theory."

---

### SLIDE 27: Why Blending Is Fatal

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Visual — vertical dilution diagram (centered):**

Each row: a horizontal line of 10 small circles. One is highlighted; the rest are neutral gray.

- **Row 1:** One DEEP RED circle among 9 gray. Right label: `Beneficial mutation appears`
- ↓ (thin arrow)
- **Row 2:** Two MEDIUM PINK among 8 gray. Right label: `Halved by mating`
- ↓
- **Row 3:** Three BARELY PINK among 7 gray. Right label: `Halved again`
- ↓
- **Row 4:** All identical gray. Right label: `Gone.` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Signal Red

**Below (on final click):**
- `Under blending, any advantage dissolves in 3–4 generations.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `Selection has nothing to select. The algorithm breaks.` — Inter, 20pt, Ember

**Build:** One row per click (4 clicks). Bottom text with Row 4.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"[click] A beneficial mutation appears. Great — selection should spread it. [click] But the organism mates with a normal partner. Under blending, the trait halves. [click] Next generation — halved again. [click] Gone. Dissolved. Like a drop of hot sauce in a swimming pool. Under blending inheritance, natural selection is impossible. Any advantage disappears before it can spread. The whole theory collapses."

- `I have ever received."` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Slate, italic
- [12px gap]
- `For a Victorian gentleman, that translates to:` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- `"I am deeply screwed."` — Inter, 20pt, Ember

**Build:** Main on load. Quote + translation on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"1867. A Scottish engineer named Fleeming Jenkin does the math. Published proof: under blending inheritance, Darwin's mechanism doesn't work. Cannot work. [click] Darwin's response: 'one of the most valuable criticisms I have ever received.' Which, in Victorian English, roughly translates to 'I am deeply screwed.' [let laughter land] He knew. He'd been afraid of this for years."

### SLIDE 29: Digital vs. Analog — The Coin Moment

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Layout:** Two columns, separated by thin vertical line (Slate at 25%).

**Left column:**
- `WHAT DARWIN NEEDED` — Inter, 14pt, Ember, caps, letter-spacing +2pt
- [20px gap]
- `DIGITAL` — Playfair Display, 48pt, white
- [14px gap]
- Visual: Two coins — heads, tails. Clean graphic.
- `Heads or tails. Never both.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `Information preserved.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate

**Right column (on click):**
- `WHAT EVERYONE ASSUMED` — Inter, 14pt, Ember, caps, letter-spacing +2pt
- [20px gap]
- `ANALOG` — Playfair Display, 48pt, white
- [14px gap]
- Visual: Two paint colors swirled into murky blend.
- `Mix forever. Never unmix.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `Information destroyed.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate

**Build:** Left on load. Right on click.

**🪙 PHYSICAL PROP MOMENT:** Presenter pulls out a coin and (optionally) a small cup of pre-mixed murky water. "Darwin needed THIS [flips coin] — discrete, either-or, the information survives intact. [click] Everyone assumed THIS [holds up murky water] — paint. Once it blends, the red is gone forever. Without digital inheritance, the algorithm can't run."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Darwin needed inheritance to work like THIS. [flip coin] Heads or tails. Discrete. The information survives. You can pass a coin from generation to generation and it stays heads or tails forever. [click] Everyone assumed inheritance worked like THIS. [hold up cup] Paint. Once you mix it, the red is gone. You can never get it back. And that's the problem: without digital inheritance, without variation that PERSISTS, natural selection has nothing to grab. The whole thing dies."

### SLIDE 30: The Lowest Point

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Stark. Minimal. The emotional bottom of the presentation.**

**Text (centered, very generous whitespace):**
- `Charles Darwin died in 1882.` — Playfair Display, 28pt, white

- `He never solved this problem.` — Playfair Display, 28pt, white

**Build:** Line 1 on load. Line 2 fades in on click after a 2-second pause.

**No images. No decoration. Emptiness IS the design.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
[Quietly, slowly] "He spent twenty years trying workarounds. Provisional hypotheses. Pangenesis. None of them held. [click] He died knowing his life's work had a hole he couldn't fix."

[**3–4 seconds of silence. Do not fill this. Look at the room.**]

### SLIDE 31: Meanwhile — The Monastery

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Full-bleed image, no solid background.

**Visual:** A monastery garden in golden afternoon light. Stone walls. Neat rows of pea plants. A single monk figure in the middle distance tending plants. Warm. Quiet. The visual OPPOSITE of the stark darkness of Slide 30 — like stepping from a funeral into a garden.

**AI prompt:** "Monastery garden in Brno Moravia 1860s, golden afternoon sunlight, old stone walls, orderly rows of green pea plants, a single monk in dark robes tending plants in middle distance, dappled light through trees, romantic realist oil painting style, warm tones, peaceful, 16:9 cinematic"

**Text overlay (bottom-left, over subtle dark gradient):**
- `Brno, Moravia. 1856–1863.` — Inter, 18pt, white, italic

**Build:** Static.

**🎯 INTERACTION — Show of Hands:**
"Meanwhile. While Darwin is tormented in England, a monk in what's now the Czech Republic is counting pea plants. For eight years. Failed his teaching exam. Twice. Lot of free time. [beat] Quick — show of hands. Who thinks Darwin ever read this monk's paper?"
[Take hands. Nod. Acknowledge.]
"Nobody should have raised their hand. He never saw it."

### SLIDE 32: Mendel's Discovery

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Layout:** Top 55% = crossing diagram. Bottom 45% = the punchline.

**TOP — crossing diagram (visual, not just text):**

**Cross 1:**
- Tall pea plant icon × Short pea plant icon → Arrow → ALL Tall pea plants (F1)
- Label: `If blending: expect medium. Mendel got ALL TALL.`

**Cross 2:**
- Tall F1 × Tall F1 → Arrow → 3 Tall : 1 Short (F2)
- The SHORT plant highlighted with Ember circle/glow
- Label: `"It came back. Full strength. Unchanged."` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Ember, italic

**BOTTOM (on click) — comparison:**

Left: `BLENDING ✗` — Signal Red
- Red circle + White circle → Pink circle
- `Traits dissolve.` — Inter, 16pt

Right: `PARTICULATE ✓` — Deep Moss
- Red circle + White circle → both visible (side by side in one organism outline)
- `Traits persist. One hides. Both survive.` — Inter, 16pt

**Centered below:**
`Inheritance isn't paint. It's coins.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember

**Build:** Top on load. Bottom on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Mendel crosses tall peas with short. If blending is right, he gets medium. He doesn't — ALL tall. OK, weird. Then he crosses those tall plants with each other. And SHORT comes back. Full strength. Not diluted — HIDING. [click] Genes aren't paint. They're coins. You carry both parents' coins. One might face down, invisible, but it's still in your pocket. Pass it to your kid and it might flip face-up again. Variation preserved across generations. Exactly. What. Darwin. Needed."

### SLIDE 34: The Modern Synthesis + Transition

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**TOP (55%):**

Two boxes side by side → merging arrow → center result box.

**Left box (Deep Moss border):**
`DARWIN'S ALGORITHM` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Obsidian

- `That changed in 1953.` — Inter, 22pt, Obsidian
- [16px gap]
- `Watson and Crick: "We have found the secret of life."` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember, italic
- `(Built on Rosalind Franklin's X-ray data. She didn't get credit.)` — Inter, 14pt, Slate

**Build:** Top on load. Bottom on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"1920s through the '40s. A group of mathematicians — Fisher, Haldane, Wright — prove that Mendelian genetics IS the engine of Darwin's theory. The Modern Synthesis: selection plus discrete inheritance equals a complete, working theory of evolution. Only took sixty years. [click] But genes were still a concept. Nobody had seen one, touched one, or knew what they were made of. 1953 changes that — Watson and Crick solve the structure of DNA. Very important caveat: Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography data was central to the discovery, and she didn't receive the credit she deserved. But the double helix immediately showed what genes physically are — and suddenly Darwin's abstractions became molecules."

## ═══════════════════════════════════════
## ACT VI: DNA + EVO-DEVO — Slides 35–40 (~10 min)
## "Same Bricks, Different Blueprints"
## ═══════════════════════════════════════

**Section objective:** This is where the presentation VISUALLY EVOLVES. Sharper. Cooler. Contemporary data-visualization aesthetic. We're leaving the 19th century and entering modern molecular biology. The slides should FEEL different — cooler blues and greens, cleaner geometry, more precision.

**Visual mode:** Science magazine. Deep Moss and Glacier Blue become prominent. Less canvas texture, more clean white. The "naturalist journal" has become a "Nature cover."

### SLIDE 35: DNA — Speed Round

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Visual:** Full-bleed AI-generated cinematic DNA helix. Glowing. Depth of field. Not a textbook diagram — a movie poster.

**AI prompt:** "Cinematic DNA double helix extreme close-up, glowing amber and green base pairs against deep dark background, volumetric lighting, shallow depth of field, phosphate backbone visible, molecular detail, science fiction aesthetic but scientifically accurate, 16:9"

**Text overlay (bottom, over dark gradient):**
`A · T · C · G` — JetBrains Mono, 30pt, Ember, letter-spacing +6pt
`Four letters. Every living thing on Earth.` — Inter, 18pt, white at 65%

**Build:** Static. **PACING: 30 seconds MAX.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Speed round — you know most of this. DNA. Double helix. Four chemical bases: A, T, C, G. Sequence spells instructions. Instructions build proteins. Proteins do everything. The structure explains its own replication — unzip down the middle, each side is a template for a new copy. Now Darwin's abstractions are physical: variation means different DNA sequences, heritability means DNA copies itself, selection means some sequences build better survivors. Let's move."

### SLIDE 36: Mutation + The Similarity Bomb

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**This slide combines two beats into one — mutation types, human examples, and the gene count surprise. Dense but well-structured.**

**TOP THIRD — Mutation header + three columns:**

**Header:**
`MUTATION: where all new variation comes from` — Playfair Display, 22pt, Obsidian
`A copying error in DNA. The raw material for evolution.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate

**Three cards side by side:**

Card 1 (Signal Red top border):
`HARMFUL` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Signal Red
`Most common. Reduces fitness.` — Inter, 14pt, Slate
`Usually eliminated by selection.` — Inter, 14pt, Slate

Card 2 (Slate top border):
`NEUTRAL` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Slate
`Very common. No effect.` — Inter, 14pt, Slate
`Accumulates silently — useful as molecular clocks.` — Inter, 14pt, Slate

Card 3 (Ember top border):
`BENEFICIAL` — Playfair Display, 18pt, Ember
`Rare. Confers advantage.` — Inter, 14pt, Slate
`Spreads through populations.` — Inter, 14pt, Slate

**MIDDLE THIRD (on click) — two human examples side by side:**

Left: 🩸 `SICKLE CELL TRAIT` — Playfair Display, 16pt, Ember
`One base-pair change. In malaria zones: carriers survive at higher rates.` — Inter, 14pt, Obsidian
`Natural selection in humans. Right now.` — Inter, 14pt, Ember

Right: 🥛 `LACTASE PERSISTENCE` — Playfair Display, 16pt, Ember
`~10,000-year-old regulatory mutation. Adults can digest milk.` — Inter, 14pt, Obsidian
`Most of you who drink milk carry this mutation.` — Inter, 14pt, Ember

**BOTTOM THIRD (on second click) — similarity + gene count:**

Horizontal bar chart:
```
HUMAN vs. CHIMP     ████████████████████░   98.7%
HUMAN vs. FLY       ████████████░░░░░░░░░   ~60%
```
Bars in Ember.

Below:
```
HUMAN    ████████████████████   ~20,000 genes
RICE     ██████████████████████████████   ~37,000 genes 🌾
```
Bars in Deep Moss.

Below bars:
`If it's not which genes or how many — what IS the difference?` — Playfair Display, 22pt, Ember

**Build:** Top on load. Middle on click. Bottom on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Where does variation come from? Mutations. DNA copying errors. Three kinds: harmful — most common, usually killed off. Neutral — no effect, accumulates silently; actually useful as a molecular clock because it ticks at a steady rate, so we can date when species diverged. Beneficial — rare, but when it hits, it spreads. [click] Two examples you should know. Sickle cell: one letter change in your DNA. Normally a problem, but in malaria zones, carriers survive at higher rates. That's natural selection in humans, right now, not ancient history. Lactase persistence: about 10,000 years ago, a mutation let some adults keep digesting milk. In cattle-herding cultures, huge advantage. Most of you who can drink a latte carry this mutation. Evolution shaped YOUR genome. Recently. [click] Now — you and a chimp share 98.7% of your DNA. You and a fruit fly: 60%. Common ancestry confirmed at the molecular level. But here's the weird part — humans have about 20,000 genes. Rice has 37,000. [PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER. Do not talk over it.] You are, genetically speaking, simpler than what you had for lunch. So if the difference between you and a worm — or you and rice — isn't which genes or how many... what IS it?"

### SLIDE 37a: The Answer — Regulatory Genes + Pax6 Setup

**Mode:** TEACHING → IMPACT
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6) transitioning to Obsidian

**TOP HALF (Bone background) — Master switches:**
- `It's not about having different genes.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Obsidian
- `It's about USING them differently.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Ember
- [20px gap]
- `1980s: fruit fly experiments reveal master regulatory genes —` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
- `switches that tell OTHER genes where and when to activate.` — Inter, 20pt, Ember
- [12px gap]
- `"Build an eye HERE" · "Grow a leg HERE" · "This end is the HEAD"` — JetBrains Mono, 18pt, Ember
- [16px gap]
- `Hox · Pax6 · Sonic Hedgehog · BMP` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `Same master genes in flies, worms, fish, mice, and humans.` — Inter, 18pt, Obsidian
- `Not similar genes. THE SAME GENES. Conserved 500+ million years.` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Ember

**BOTTOM HALF (on click, Obsidian background panel):**

Image right: Real photograph of Antennapedia mutant fly — legs where antennae should be.
Caption: `Antennapedia mutant. One switch gene. Legs where antennae should be.` — Inter, 13pt, Slate

Text left:
- `Mutate one address label:` — Inter, 18pt, white
- `fully formed legs grow from the head.` — Inter, 18pt, Ember
- `One gene. Wrong address.` — Inter, 18pt, white
- `Everything downstream obeyed.` — Inter, 18pt, white

**Build:** Top on load. Bottom on click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"HERE'S the answer. It's not about having different genes — it's about using them differently. In the 1980s, scientists studying fruit flies discover master regulatory genes. These genes don't build body parts — they're ADDRESS LABELS. They tell other genes where to turn on. 'Build an eye here.' 'This end is the head.' And the stunning part: these master genes aren't unique to flies. They appear across the entire animal kingdom. Mice, fish, worms, humans. Not similar genes — THE SAME GENES. Conserved for over 500 million years. How interchangeable are they? [click] This interchangeable. A real fly. Mutate one switch — one address label — and fully formed LEGS grow from its head. The gene said 'leg' instead of 'antenna' and the entire developmental program obeyed. One gene."

### ⭐ SLIDE 37b: THE PAX6 EXPERIMENT — Emotional Climax

**Mode:** IMPACT (MAXIMUM)
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**This is the peak. Every design choice serves the reveal. Pacing is SACRED.**

**🎯 PRE-SLIDE INTERACTION:** Before advancing to this slide: "OK — I want genuine predictions. Scientists took the eye-development gene — Pax6 — from a mouse. They put it into a fruit fly embryo. These species last shared an ancestor 500 million years ago. What do you think happens? Actual guesses." Take 2–3 answers. Then advance.

**Build sequence (one click each, centered):**

**Click 1:**
`They took the eye gene from a mouse.` — Inter, 24pt, white
[40px gap]

**Click 2:**
`They put it into a fruit fly embryo.` — Inter, 24pt, white
[80px gap]

**[MANDATORY 3-SECOND SILENCE.]**

**Click 3 — THE REVEAL:**
`The fly grew an eye.` — Playfair Display, 44pt, Ember, bold
[12px gap]
`A fly eye. Compound lenses. In the right place.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Ember

**[MANDATORY 4–5 SECOND SILENCE.]**

**Click 4:**
`500 million years of divergence.` — Inter, 18pt, white at 65%
`The instruction set still works across species.` — Inter, 18pt, white at 65%

**Build:** 4 clicks. The silences are non-negotiable.

**🎬 VIDEO ALTERNATIVE (20–25 sec):** Animation: mouse silhouette → zoom to DNA → Pax6 gene highlighted → extracted → travels across screen → enters fly embryo → eye develops → pull back to compound fly eye.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
[Before slide:] "Genuine guesses — what happens? Mouse eye gene, fly embryo, 500 million years apart. What do you get?" [Take 2–3 guesses.]

"[click] They took the eye gene from a mouse. [click] Put it into a fly embryo."
[3 full seconds silence.]
"[click] The fly grew an eye. A FLY eye. Compound lenses. Correct location. Not a mouse eye. A fly eye. The mouse gene carried the instruction 'build an eye here' and the fly's body executed it in FLY format."
[4–5 seconds silence.]
"[click] These species last shared a common ancestor 500 million years ago. Before dinosaurs. Before jaws. The instruction manual is that old. And it still compiles."

"I'll let you sit with that."

**DO NOT RUSH THIS. This is the emotional peak of the entire presentation. If you rush it, everything afterward deflates.**

### SLIDE 38: The Evolution of the Eye — Full Circle

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Visual (center, 55% of slide):** Horizontal five-stage evolutionary progression, left to right. Clean scientific illustration with artistic flair. Connected by arrows.

| Stage | Visual | Function Label |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Flat patch of cells on a surface | `Light / Dark` |
| 2 | Cup-shaped depression | `Direction` |
| 3 | Narrow pinhole opening | `Crude image` |
| 4 | Sphere with simple lens | `Focused image` |
| 5 | Full camera eye cross-section | `High resolution` |

**AI prompt:** "Scientific diagram of five evolutionary stages of the eye, horizontal left to right with arrows between stages: 1) flat light-sensitive cell patch 2) curved cup shape 3) pinhole camera 4) simple lens eye 5) full camera eye cross-section, clean line illustration style with warm amber and moss green accents, labeled stages, scientific but elegant, 16:9"

Each stage appears on click (5 clicks).

**Below diagram (click 6):**
- `~400,000 generations from flat patch to camera eye.` — Playfair Display, 22pt, Obsidian
- `Eyes evolved independently over 40 times.` — Inter, 20pt, Ember
- `Nearly all controlled by Pax6 — the same ancient switch.` — Inter, 20pt, Ember
- [10px gap]
- `The eye isn't evidence against evolution.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `It's one of evolution's easiest tricks.` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Ember, italic

**Build:** 6 clicks total.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Remember Slide 1? The eye. Paley's strongest argument. Darwin himself said it gave him a cold shudder. But here's what we now know. [click] Start with a flat patch of cells that sense light from dark. Already useful — you know day from night. [click] Curve it into a cup — now you know DIRECTION. [click] Narrow the opening — pinhole camera, crude image. [click] Add a lens — focused image. [click] Refine — high resolution. Each step is a small, independently useful improvement. No magic. Computer models show the whole sequence takes about 400,000 generations. And eyes didn't evolve once — they evolved independently over 40 times across the animal kingdom. Octopus eyes. Insect eyes. Your eyes. Separate inventions. And nearly all of them are controlled by Pax6 — the same ancient switch we just watched work across mice and flies. Different engineering. Same foundation. [click] The eye isn't evidence against evolution. It's one of evolution's easiest tricks."

### SLIDE 39: Same Bricks, Different Blueprints — The Regulatory Revolution

**Mode:** IMPACT
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Text (centered, build):**

**Click 1:**
`40+ independent origins of the eye.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, white
`Different structures. Different optics.` — Inter, 20pt, Slate

**Click 2:**
`Same ancient master switch: Pax6.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Ember

**Click 3:**
`Evolution doesn't mainly invent new genes.` — Inter, 22pt, white
`It rewires the instructions:` — Inter, 22pt, white

**Click 4:**
[16px gap]
`Same Lego bricks.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember, italic
`Different instruction manual.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember, italic

**Build:** 4 clicks.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"[click] 40-plus eyes. Independently evolved. Different structures, different optics. [click] Nearly all controlled by the same gene: Pax6. 500 million years old. [click] This is the revelation: evolution doesn't write new code. It rewires existing code — turns genes on earlier, later, stronger, in new locations. [click] Same Lego bricks. Different instruction manual. That's how you get from a fly to a human with basically the same toolkit."

### SLIDE 40: Partner Callback — Connecting the Toolkit

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Simple, clean. A breathing slide.**

**Text (centered):**

- [16px gap]
- `Same logic. One level deeper.` — Playfair Display, 26pt, Ember
- [12px gap]

- `[Partner's name] showed you what this toolkit produces.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate
- `We just looked under the hood.` — Inter, 18pt, Slate

**Build:** Static.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Quick connection back. [Partner] showed you what the toolkit PRODUCES on the Galápagos — different beaks, different shells, different everything. We just looked at the toolkit itself. The finches don't have different beak genes. They have the same genes with different switches — turned on at different times, in different strengths. Same bricks. Different manual. Darwin saw the output. We just saw the source code."

### SLIDE 41: Beyond Darwin — Expansions + The News

**Mode:** TEACHING → IMPACT
**Background:** Split — Bone top half, Obsidian bottom half.

**TOP HALF (Bone) — two columns:**

**Left:**
- `EPIGENETICS` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Obsidian
- `Chemical marks change how genes are read` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- `without changing the DNA.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- `Some marks pass to your children.` — Inter, 16pt, Ember

**Right (on click):**
- `HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER` — Playfair Display, 20pt, Obsidian
- `Bacteria swap genes sideways.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- `No reproduction needed.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate
- `Darwin's tree is really a web.` — Inter, 16pt, Ember

**Between halves:** `Not a rejection of Darwin. An expansion.` — Inter, 16pt, Slate, italic

**BOTTOM HALF (Obsidian, on second click) — three items in a row:**

`Antibiotic resistance` (Ember) · `COVID variants` (Ember) · `Cancer drug resistance` (Ember)
`— all running Darwin's algorithm. Right now. In hospitals.` — Inter, 18pt, white

`Natural selection isn't history. It's the news.` — Playfair Display, 24pt, Ember

**Build:** Top-left on load. Top-right on click. Bottom on second click.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Two expansions, fast. Epigenetics: chemical marks on DNA that change gene expression WITHOUT changing the sequence — and some pass to your kids. Your grandparents' environment can mark your genes. [click] Horizontal gene transfer: bacteria swap genes sideways, like AirDropping genetic material on the subway. Darwin's tree becomes a web at the microbial level. Neither overturns Darwin — both expand the picture. [click] And here's why this matters TODAY. Antibiotic resistance — bacteria outevolving our drugs. COVID variants — natural selection on a global stage, we watched it live. Cancer — tumors evolving drug resistance inside your body using Darwin's exact algorithm. Evolution isn't chapter 12 in a textbook. It's the most urgent science happening in hospitals right now."

### SLIDE 42: The Universal Code

**Mode:** TEACHING
**Background:** Bone (#FAF9F6)

**Visual:** Full-slide codon wheel or genetic code table. Colorful, detailed, mandala-like. Beautiful scientific data visualization.

**AI prompt:** "Circular genetic code codon wheel diagram, all 64 codons mapping to amino acids, colorful with amber greens and blues, elegant scientific visualization, detailed but readable, radial symmetry, 16:9"

**Text (bottom):**
`Every living cell on Earth reads from this same dictionary.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian
`Bacteria. Trees. Whales. You.` — Inter, 20pt, Obsidian

**Build:** Static.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"Every living cell uses this code. Same mapping from DNA triplets to amino acids. Bacteria, plants, animals, everyone in this room. The probability of this arising independently more than once is effectively zero. One dictionary. Written once. Billions of years ago."

### SLIDE 43: Darwin's Words

**Mode:** CINEMATIC
**Background:** Obsidian (#0F172A)

**Text (centered, generous line spacing):**
```
"...from so simple a beginning
endless forms most beautiful
and most wonderful
have been, and are being, evolved."
```
— Playfair Display, 30pt, white, italic

**Attribution:**
`— On the Origin of Species, final sentence, 1859` — Inter, 14pt, Ember

**Build:** Entire quote fades in as one unit (1.2s).

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
"After 500 pages about death, extinction, competition, and the demolition of every comforting story about where we come from — Darwin ended with this. He insisted on grandeur. The final word of the Origin is 'evolved.' [beat] What's more grand: that life was placed here, fully formed, by a designer? Or that a single cell bootstrapped itself into everything you see — with no plan, no goal — and it's still going?"

## Q&A backup only. Never shown proactively.
## ═══════════════════════════════════════

### SLIDE A1: What Evolution Doesn't Explain
`Appropriate Humility` — Playfair Display, 28pt
Evolution explains adaptation and diversity. NOT origin of life, consciousness, or meaning. Good theories have scope. Darwin would agree.
**USE WHEN:** "Where did the first cell come from?" / "Does evolution explain consciousness?"

### SLIDE A2: What Makes Us Human?
`The 1.3% That Matters` — Playfair Display, 28pt
98.7% shared with chimps. Differences concentrated in REGULATORY regions — especially brain development timing. Longer development, more complex schedules. Same genes, different switches. Evo-devo applied to neuroscience.
**USE WHEN:** "If we're 98% chimp, what's the difference?"

### SLIDE A3: Arms Races
`The Red Queen` — Playfair Display, 28pt
Predator-prey and parasite-host co-evolution. Both sides evolve in response to each other. Running as fast as they can to stay in place. Cheetah vs. gazelle. Immune system vs. viruses.
**USE WHEN:** "Why doesn't evolution just solve disease?"

## THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING

This presentation has one job: make 15 people FEEL something. Not just learn — feel. The eye on Slide 1 should make them certain it's designed. The algorithm on Slide 19 should make them uncertain. The Pax6 experiment on Slide 37b should make them quiet. The close on Slide 44 should make them slightly dizzy.

Information is the vehicle. Awe is the destination.
